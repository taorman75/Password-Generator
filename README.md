# Password-Generator
This simple Javascript-based password generator will generate a password when the user clicks on the "generate password" button.

The password will have the number of characters selected by the user (between 8 and 128 inclusive); if the user picks a number outside of those parameters, they will get an error message. 

They can choose upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and/or special characters. They have to confirm at least one of those choices or they will receive an error message.

Once they go through all the prompts, the user's randomly-generated password prints to the password area on the page.
